# Hulu | Next.js with Server-side Rendering

![banner](banner.png)

> In this project I used the `getServerSideProps` function which makes Next.js `pre-render` the page on each request using the data returned by getServerSideProps, and is only executed on the server side. Inside `utils` there is a Javascript object in which there is all the data necessary to make the necessary requests using the Fetch API according to the genre sent `through the url query`. The base project was taught on the <strong>Sonny Sangha</strong> channel.
