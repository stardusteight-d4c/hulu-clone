# Hulu | Next.js with Server-side Rendering

![cover](cover.png)

> Once again practicing API Requests and Next.js with `Sonny Sangha`, the Next.js Server-side Rendering Feature was used in this project, in which the asyncrona function getServerSideProps is called by the server on each request, so if a page uses server-side rendering, the page's HTML is generated on every request. With the react-flip-move library, it is possible to add transition animations in the rendering of the components of the results.
